# Web_Connection_NET üìå

Web_Connection_NET is a project designed to showcase my skills in mastering ASP.NET, utilizing it in a web-based environment to handle scenarios involving dynamic permission management and secure data interaction. This approach simplifies project security and management while enabling seamless integration of new features and collaboration with team members.

## Versions
The project will continue to evolve, with updates bringing new functionalities that reflect my growing capabilities. Each release will be documented with the release date to track progress effectively.

# Implementation üö©

Currently, the application operates using a local database, and the required queries to set up all necessary data are included within the API project. Follow these steps to get started:

## Requirements

- Database: SQL Server
- SQL Express - localhost
- .NET 7.0 or higher
- Bootstrap (latest version included in the project)
- FontAwesome library for icons

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Clone the repositories for both the web application and the API.
   - Web application repository: [Web_Connection_NET](https://github.com/your-repo-link)
   - API repository: [Web_API_ASPNET](https://github.com/JeanPasquini/webapi_aspnet)
2. Set up the database by following the instructions provided in the API repository. Additionally, you need to download the database file from the complementary repository: [APP_NET_Framework](https://github.com/JeanPasquini/app_net_framework).
3. Configure the connection string in the API project to match your local SQL Server instance.
4. Run the API project to start the backend server.
5. Open the web application and configure the necessary settings (e.g., API endpoint URL).
6. Use the predefined user accounts (admin and user, both with the password '1234') to log in and explore the application.
